Project Title : Loan Prediction
Objective :
To come up with either the customer will get the loan or not actually it's a binary classification problem. I required to build the model that the loan Prediction with its independence variable (Loan_status).
Steps and tasks :
Step 1: Reading and Understanding the Data
Step 2 : Data Cleaning and Preparation
Step 3: Visualizing the data
Step 3.1 : Visualising Categorical Data
Step 4 : Dummy Variables
Step 5 : Deriving new features
Step 6 : Residual Analysis of Model
Step 7 : Train-Test Split and feature scaling
Step 8 : Model Building
Step 9 : Prediction and Evaluation
